I didn't really notice it while growing up, but over time I've realized I have some habits that could look minimalist. I don't even know if that's the right word for it. I'm not sure there's a term that describes it exactly.

I guess I was never a very messy person to begin with. I have always kept my space and my things fairly organized and clean, even during my college days. Nothing extreme, just basic habits. Cleaning my room, keeping things where they belong, making my bed after waking up. Basic stuff.

I wouldn't say I am obsessed with cleanliness. If something is messy for a while, it doesn't completely stress me out or ruin my day. I just don't like it. It sits in the back of my mind until it's fixed.

Right now, I live alone in a single apartment, in a city that's different from my hometown. Even though I don't work from home, I still make sure my apartment stays clean.

# On Buying Things

I'm not a minimalist when it comes to spending money. I just don't buy things impulsively. I enjoy buying what I want or need, and I usually only pause to think when it’s expensive . I don't buy things out of habit.

# It Just Works

For me, this isn't some philosophy I am following. It's just a way to get my mind to feel clearer. If my space is clean, I can settle in immediately. If my desk is organized, I can just start working. It takes care of small problems before they even come up.

I don't have a full answer yet on what drives this. I know that clutter doesn't make me anxious the way it does for some people. But I also know that when my space is simple, I feel lighter. Whether that's psychology or just preference, I'm not sure. But it works for me.

Thanks for reading.
