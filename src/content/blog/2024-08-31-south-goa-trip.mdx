After our lively trip to North Goa in April, we decided it was time to explore South Goa. North Goa had been all about parties and crowds, but South Goa, we heard, was more peaceful, with quiet beaches and relaxed vibes. So, we booked our tickets and packed our bags for a serene getaway in June 2024.

## Getting There

Our journey began with a late-night Indigo flight from Hyderabad to Goa. The tickets were surprisingly cheap—only 2,200 INR per person. We landed at Dabolim Airport around 12:30 AM on 16th June. Now, here's the thing—Goa doesn't have Uber or Ola, so we had to get creative with transport. We used the GoaMiles app to book a cab to Palolem. Since it was late at night, the ride wasn’t the cheapest, and we ended up paying around 2,200-2,400 INR for the cab.

Once we arrived in Palolem, we checked into a guest house for the first night, just a place to crash after a long journey.

## Day 1: 16th June – Embracing the Unexpected

The next morning, we were ready to start our day. After a peaceful night’s rest, we went for breakfast and found a nice spot called [The Mill](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Y8XdHyxkxj38mDGS8) in Palolem. It was a great start to the day with fresh food
We rented a scooter for just 300 INR per day – a perfect way to get around and explore the area at our own pace. The first stop was Palolem Beach. But, as if on cue, the weather turned! It started raining heavily, but we didn’t let that stop us. We grabbed some raincoats and carried on with our plans.

One of the highlights of the day was the boat ride through the backwaters of Palolem. For just 400 INR per boat, we were taken on a serene tour through the lush green waters. The rain actually made the whole experience feel a little magical, with the misty atmosphere adding a special touch.

After the boat ride, we had a lovely lunch near Palolem Beach. Later, we took the opportunity to go kayaking near Agonda at [Treetop Tava](https://maps.app.goo.gl/UuYrxAhbc3fbQETC6). Of course, the rain didn’t stop us.

By evening, we were back at the hostel, where we had a satisfying dinner and reflected on how much fun we’d had despite the rain.

## Day 2: 17th June – Kayaking, Beaches, and Exploration

The next day, we moved to[ Whoppers Party Hostel](https://maps.app.goo.gl/qPxR3gdneBDG8KfR9) (2,100 INR per day).

We decided to go kayaking again because we’d had so much fun the day before. This time, we were up bright and early at 10 AM and headed straight to Agonda Beach. The water was calm, and the experience was even better than the first day.

After kayaking, we explored Agonda Beach and found a cozy restaurant for lunch. Agonda had a peaceful vibe—perfect for taking a break and soaking in the natural beauty.

In the afternoon, we made our way to Cabo de Rama Fort, a historic site with breathtaking views. The beach nearby was quiet and relaxing, and we spent some time there before heading back.

We also visited Cola Beach on our way back to Palolem. Getting there was a bit tricky, as it’s tough to reach by scooter. But we didn’t mind, as we took a 250 INR per person Bolero ride to the beach. Once we were there, we relaxed and watched the sunset. Cola Beach is also famous for kayaking, although we didn’t try it here. The sunset views, however, were perfect.

## Day 3: 18th June – More Kayaking and Peaceful Beaches

On our final day, we went kayaking again. This time, we went even farther out into the water, enjoying the serenity and the clear skies.

After kayaking, we visited Galgibaga Beach. This beach was nearly empty, offering a peaceful atmosphere where we spent a good amount of time. Later, we made our way to Rajbag Beach, which was also quiet and calm. We stayed there till sunset, taking in the views.

We wrapped up the evening back at Palolem Beach. We roamed around, had a nice dinner, and made our way back to the hostel around 11 PM.

### Heading Home

Our flight was at 7 AM the next day, and we knew it would be difficult to find an online cab early in the morning. So, we had pre-booked a cab through our hostel manager, making the morning transfer smooth and stress-free.

### Reflections

Even though we missed some places, this trip was exactly what we needed. While North Goa gave us crazy parties and crowds, South Goa was all about chill vibes, empty beaches, and peaceful sunsets. Sometimes the best trips are the ones where you don't do much - just relax, explore at your own pace, and enjoy the moment. That's what South Goa was for us.
