### Note: 

Okay, so I'm writing this down mostly for myself. Maybe a friend or two might read it, but honestly? This is just my way of remembering our trip. Yeah, it might sound repetitive or boring, but hey, these are memories I want to keep.

## Travel Dates: June 28 to July 1st

### Getting There

We started our trip with a super early morning flight from Hyderabad (RGIA) to Goa's Dabolim Airport. The flight was at 5:30 AM, which meant we left home around 2 AM. Sleep was hard to come by that night.

We landed around 6:30-7:00 AM and immediately faced our first travel decision: transportation. We could either take an expensive private cab (around ₹2,500) or try public transport. My friend convinced me to take the local buses, and I'm glad we did.

Just a 5-minute walk from the airport, we found our bus. It was coming from Panjim and heading to Margao. The ticket was cheap - just ₹40-50 per person. At Margao, we found direct buses to Palolem Beach, another ₹40 per person and about a 1.5-hour journey.

### Day 1 - June 28

Our previous experience at Whoppers Party Hostel in Palolem had been good, so we decided to stay there again, at least initially. Check-in was at 12 PM, so we first rented a scooter for ₹450 per day.

The room, however, was a disappointment. It was smelly and dirty, but having already paid ₹2,000 for two people, we decided to make do for a night. Before settling in, we had breakfast at The CasaNova Restaurant near Palolem Beach - nothing extraordinary, but it did the job.

Lunch was at Olives Restaurant, also near the beach. We rested through the afternoon and then explored the Palolem backwaters. Despite the heavy rain, it was a memorable experience.

That evening, we realized Whoppers wasn't going to work for us. After some searching, we found Hotel Sobit Sarovar Portico, a 4-star hotel charging ₹4,000 per night for two people. We booked it for the next two days.

Dinner was at Cleo's Cafe & Restaurant - absolutely delicious - before we called it a night.

### Day 2 - June 29

Breakfast was again at Cleo's Cafe. With time to kill before our hotel check-in, we explored Agonda Beach, about 4-5 km away. After a leisurely morning, we checked out of Whoppers and into our new hotel.

The hotel was comfortable, and we enjoyed a ₹2,000 buffet lunch. In the evening, we visited Galgibaga Beach - almost entirely deserted and wonderfully peaceful.

Dinner was back at our favorite Cleo's Cafe, followed by a nighttime stroll through Palolem market.

### Day 3 - June 30

We started early with kayaking near Agonda. The experience was neither exceptional nor terrible - just okay. Back at the hotel, I enjoyed some swimming pool time.

The highlight was our trek to Cola Beach. Instead of paying ₹150 per person for a jeep ride down the challenging, steep road, we decided to hike. It was tough but totally worth it - the beach was serene and beautiful.

Dinner at Cleo's Cafe (yes, again!) and an evening at Palolem Beach rounded out our day.

### Day 4 - July 1st

Our last day was relaxed. After a complimentary breakfast and hotel check-out, we spent the morning at peaceful Rajbhag Beach.

Lunch was at The Olives, and then we began our journey back. We chose public transport to Madgaon, which was much cheaper. From there, we took a cab to the airport, arriving by 6:30 PM for our 9 PM flight.

We landed in Hyderabad around 11 PM, tired but happy.
