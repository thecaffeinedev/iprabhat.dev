I bought my iPhone 13 on March 2, 2022, for around INR 66K after discounts. Before that, I had a OnePlus 7T for two years. I switched because the OnePlus battery was fading fast, and gaming didn’t help 😅. Since I already had a MacBook, the iPhone felt like a no-brainer.

I got the base iPhone 13 model. Having tinkered with Android phones from 2015 to 2022—flashing custom ROMs and tweaking everything—I’ve now used both platforms enough to share my take. Three years in, here’s what I like and don’t like about the iPhone 13.

## What I Like
* **Software Updates**: It’s 2025, and my iPhone 13 still gets major iOS upgrades. I think they’ll support it till 2027.
* **Hardware**:
  * **Camera**: Photos and videos are good. The quality still holds up in 2025.
  * **Display**: Vibrant colors and great accuracy.
  * **A15 Bionic Chip**: Fast and efficient, it handles most tasks smoothly even now.
* **Battery**: Good performance, though at 80% health, I sometimes charge twice daily. No random drain, which is great.
* **Airdrop**: Fast and easy for transferring photos and files.
* **Spotlight Search**: Swipe down, type, and find anything instantly.
* **Link Previews**: Long-press a link in any app to peek at the content without actually opening it in a different browser.
* **Files App**: Native SMB support makes file management better than expected.
* **Privacy**:
  * App permissions are detailed. For example, you can share specific photos, not your whole gallery.
  * Location sharing lets you choose precise or approximate data. (I think Android has this now.)
  * **Sign in with Apple**
* **Apple Ecosystem**:
  * My iPhone, MacBook, and Apple Watch work seamlessly together.
  * **Handoff**: Start an email or webpage on one device, finish on another.
  * **Universal Clipboard**: Copy on iPhone, paste on Mac—text, images, or files.
  * Send and receive texts or iMessages from my Mac or Watch.
  * Answer iPhone calls on my Mac or Watch.
  * **Continuity Camera**: Use the iPhone as a webcam for Mac (though I haven’t used it in meetings).
  * **Focus Modes**: Sync “Do Not Disturb” across all devices automatically.

## What I Don’t Like

*Based on your usage/experience you might not face some of these.*

* **File System**: No direct access to files, and managing them is a pain. The Documents app helps, but it’s clunky 😅.
* **Refresh Rate**: 60Hz refresh rate.
* **Photo Syncing**: Google Photos auto-backup works, but iOS background limits make it less seamless than Android.
* **Video Rotation**: With auto-rotation off, YouTube videos rotate incorrectly when I’m lying down. Android handles this better.
* **Keyboard**: Apple’s default keyboard has weak autocomplete, and cursor placement is still a pain. I’ve been using Gboard from day one.
* **No Force-Quitting Apps**
* **Call History**: No “edit and call” option like Android’s. I can’t tweak a number before dialing.
* **Siri**: I have not used it except for setting alarms.

I would consider switching back to Android for a phone with a great camera, solid battery, and stock Android experience. For now, the iPhone 13’s reliability and ecosystem keep me hooked, but it’s not perfect.
