So here's the thing, I have been running this blog for a while now, and recently migrated from Next.js to Astro. The whole setup is pretty straightforward: write markdown files, commit, push, and Vercel handles the deployment. Works great when I'm on my laptop.

But sometimes I'm not at my laptop. Sometimes I'm commuting, or just lying around, and an idea hits me. I want to capture it quickly before I forget. The problem is Creating a markdown file on mobile, committing it through GitHub's mobile interface... yeah, that's painful.

I mean, technically you *can* do it. Open GitHub mobile, navigate to the repo, create a new file in `src/content/blog/`, write the frontmatter manually, add the content, commit... but by the time you're done with all that, you've probably lost the flow of what you wanted to write.

## Why I Needed This

I'm not going to pretend this is some unique problem I discovered. Pretty much anyone running a static site generator has faced this at some point. You want the flexibility of markdown and git-based workflows, but you also want the convenience of being able to publish from anywhere.

I looked into a few options:
- Using Notion and syncing it to GitHub (seemed overkill)
- Setting up some fancy CMS (again, overkill for my needs)
- Building a custom PWA (tempting, but do I really need *another* side project?)

Then I remembered GitHub Issues. And I think it's kind of good for this.

I'm not saying this is the *best* way to solve this problem; there are probably fancier solutions out there. But for my use case, it works, and that's what matters.

## Why GitHub Issues Works

Think about it - GitHub Issues already has:
- A decent Github mobile app
- Markdown support with preview
- Built-in authentication (you're already logged in)
- Form templates for structured input
- Labels for categorization
- It's free

The only missing piece is the automation to convert an issue into an actual blog post. And that's where GitHub Actions comes in.

## Setting Up the Workflow

I am not going to pretend I wrote all this from scratch. I used Claude to generate the issue template and workflow, then adjusted it to match my needs. If you're running a static site with Astro, Jekyll, Hugo, or whatever, you probably know your way around GitHub Actions anyway. Here's the basic idea.

First, I created an issue template. GitHub has this feature where you can create structured forms, which is way better than just a blank text area. Here's what mine looks like:

```yaml
name: Blog Post
description: Create a new blog post
title: "[BLOG] "
labels: ["blog-post"]
body:
  - type: input
    id: title
    attributes:
      label: Title
      description: The title of your blog post
      placeholder: "My Awesome Blog Post"
    validations:
      required: true
  
  - type: textarea
    id: description
    attributes:
      label: Description
      description: A brief description for SEO and previews
      placeholder: "This post covers..."
    validations:
      required: true
  
  - type: input
    id: tags
    attributes:
      label: Tags
      description: Comma-separated tags
      placeholder: "python, web, tutorial"
  
  - type: dropdown
    id: draft
    attributes:
      label: Draft Status
      options:
        - "false"
        - "true"
      default: 0
  
  - type: textarea
    id: content
    attributes:
      label: Content
      description: Write your blog post content using Markdown
      placeholder: "Start writing your post here..."
    validations:
      required: true
```

You put this in `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/blog-post.yml` and suddenly you have a nice form when creating issues.

Then comes the GitHub Action. This is the part that actually does the work. When I add the `blog-post` label to an issue, it triggers a workflow that:

1. Parses the issue body to extract all the form fields
2. Creates a slug from the title (you know, lowercase, hyphens, all that)
3. Generates the frontmatter with the metadata
4. Writes a new markdown file to `src/content/blog/`
5. Commits and pushes it
6. Comments on the issue with the live URL
7. Closes the issue

The workflow itself is a bit messy because you're essentially writing JavaScript inside YAML, which... yeah. Not my favorite thing. But it works.

Here's the important part:

```javascript
const title = titleMatch ? titleMatch[1].trim() : issue.title.replace('[BLOG] ', '');
const description = descMatch ? descMatch[1].trim() : '';
const tags = tagsMatch ? tagsMatch[1].trim() : '';
const draft = draftMatch ? draftMatch[1].trim() === 'true' : false;
const content = contentMatch ? contentMatch[1].trim() : '';

const slug = title.toLowerCase().replace(/[^a-z0-9]+/g, '-').replace(/^-|-$/g, '');
const date = new Date().toISOString().split('T')[0];
const filename = date + '-' + slug + '.mdx';

const frontmatter = '---\ntitle: "' + title + '"\ndescription: "' + description + '"\ndate: "' + date + '"\ndraft: ' + draft + '\ntags: ' + tagsFormatted + '\n---\n\n' + content;

fs.writeFileSync(filepath, frontmatter);
```

It took me a couple of failed attempts to get this working. GitHub Actions can be tricky, especially when you're dealing with file operations. But once it clicked, it just... worked.

One important thing: the workflow only runs when I (the repo owner) create and label the issue. I added a check if: github.actor == github.repository_owner to ensure that. Since the repo is public, anyone can create issues, but the workflow won't trigger unless I'm the one who labeled it with blog-post. Nothing gets published without my action.

Here's the complete workflow if you want to check it out or adapt it for your setup:

## Using It

Now when I want to write a post from mobile:

1. Open GitHub app
2. Go to my repo, create new issue
3. Select "Blog Post" template
4. Fill in the form
5. Submit
6. GitHub Action runs, creates the post
7. Vercel deploys it
8. Done

The whole thing takes maybe 2-3 minutes, most of which is just writing the actual content. 

## Tradeoffs

Is it perfect? No. There are a few things that could be better:

**No image uploads** - GitHub Issues doesn't really have a great way to handle images. You can paste them into the issue, but then you'd need to download them and move them to your public folder. I just skip images for mobile posts. Maybe use links.

**Markdown preview could be better** - The GitHub mobile app has markdown preview, but it's not as good as a proper editor. You kind of have to trust that your syntax is right.

**Can't easily edit** - Once the issue is closed and the post is created, editing means going into the actual markdown file. Not the end of the world, but worth noting.

But honestly? For quick posts, this works great. It's simple, it's free, and I don't have to maintain any additional infrastructure.

## Wrapping Up

If you're running a static site and want an easy way to post from mobile, give GitHub Issues a shot. The setup takes maybe an hour if you're familiar with GitHub Actions, and then you're good to go.

And , if you come up with improvements or a better way to handle this, let me know. Always happy to learn from others.
